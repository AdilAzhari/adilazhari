## 👋 Hi, I’m Adil

Backend-focused software engineer based in **Malaysia** 🇲🇾
I design and build **reliable, transaction-heavy backend systems** with a strong emphasis on **clean architecture, correctness, and long-term maintainability**.

I work primarily with **Laravel**, **Inertia.js**, and **Vue.js**, using them deliberately — not as shortcuts, but as tools to express sound engineering decisions.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

I’m most effective when working on systems that require **clear domain boundaries** and **predictable behavior under load**.

My strengths include:

* Designing backend systems with **explicit domain modeling** and clean separation of concerns
* Building **RESTful APIs** with attention to idempotency, validation, and failure modes
* Structuring Laravel applications using **Actions, DTOs, Policies, and Observers**
* Designing relational databases with a strong understanding of **indexes, transactions, and consistency**
* Identifying and preventing **concurrency issues** in inventory and checkout flows
* Writing tests that cover **edge cases, failure paths, and race conditions**
* Building admin dashboards with **Filament**, including permissions, metrics, and operational workflows

### ⭐ Featured Project
🔹 **E-commerce / Supermarket Backend System**  
A production-style backend focusing on:
- Checkout orchestration
- Concurrency-safe stock reservation
- Idempotent APIs
- Explicit domain modeling
- High test coverage (failure paths & race conditions)

## 🏗️ Current Work

I’m actively building and refining:

* **Car Rental Management System**
  Focused on workflow orchestration, role-based access, and operational visibility

* **Supermarket / E-commerce System**
  A transaction-heavy backend featuring:

  * Cart → checkout orchestration
  * Stock reservation with concurrency safety
  * Idempotent checkout
  * Explicit domain exceptions
  * High test coverage for failure scenarios

My current learning priority is **architectural depth**, not new frameworks.

## 📚 What I’m Deepening Right Now

* **System Design**
  Caching strategies, background jobs, scalability trade-offs, and failure recovery

* **Testing & Reliability**
  Domain-level unit tests, feature tests, concurrency-safe test design, CI workflows

* **Laravel Internals (Advanced Use)**
  Custom pipelines, and framework extension points

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating on projects that involve:

* Backend-heavy Laravel systems
* Transactional workflows (orders, payments, inventory, scheduling)
* Operations dashboards and internal tools
* Codebases that value **clarity, discipline, and long-term maintainability**

---

## 💬 You Can Ask Me About

* Backend architecture with Laravel
* Designing clean checkout and inventory systems
* Inertia.js + Vue.js integration from a backend-first perspective
* Testing strategies for complex business logic
* Filament customization for real operational use cases

## ⚡ Engineering Philosophy

I value **predictability over cleverness** and **clarity over abstraction for its own sake**.
I enjoy refactoring existing systems because it forces better reasoning, sharper boundaries, and more deliberate trade-offs.
